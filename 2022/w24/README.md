# Week 24 challenge

Write a function `validSudoku` which accepts a two dimensional (9x9) array of numbers representing a Sudoku board. The task is to return whether this is a valid Sudoku board according to [rules](https://www.sudokuonline.io/tips/sudoku-rules).


Examples:
```
validSudoku([
  [4,1,7,2,3,8,5,6,9],
  [6,5,3,1,4,9,7,2,8],
  [8,2,9,6,5,7,1,3,4],
  [3,8,2,5,9,4,6,1,7],
  [9,7,4,3,6,1,2,8,5],
  [1,6,5,8,7,2,9,4,3],
  [2,9,6,4,8,5,3,7,1],
  [7,3,8,9,1,6,4,5,2],
  [5,4,1,7,2,3,8,9,6]
]) // returns true

validSudoku([
  [6,7,8,4,5,3,2,1,9],
  [3,4,9,2,6,1,8,5,7],
  [1,5,2,7,9,8,4,2,6],
  [8,6,1,3,4,2,7,9,5],
  [3,9,5,8,7,6,3,2,1],
  [7,2,3,5,1,9,6,8,4],
  [2,1,7,6,7,5,9,4,8],
  [5,8,4,9,2,7,1,6,3],
