# Week 27 challenge

Write a function `summedIntervals` which accepts an array of intervals (start and end number). Your task is to return the sum if all interval lengths. If some intervals are overlapping, those numbers should be counted only once.


Examples:
```
summedIntervals([[1,4], [5,7]]) // return 5
summedIntervals([[1,4], [3,8]]) // return 7
summedIntervals([[1,4], [3,8], [12,17]]) // return 12
```
