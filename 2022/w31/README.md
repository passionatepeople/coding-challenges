# Week 31 challenge

Write a function `bumpMe` which takes in a string and if it finds a number at its end, it increases the count by 1. If not, then it adds number 1 at the end.

Note: It also takes into account any prepended zeros.


Examples:
```
bumpMe('foobar4') // return 'foobar5'
bumpMe('bazbar') // return 'bazbar1'
bumpMe('barbaz0051') // return 'barbaz0052'
```
