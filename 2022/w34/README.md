# Week 34 challenge

Write a function `amIHollow` which takes in an array of numbers and returns if that array can be considered "hollow". For this challenge a "hollow" array is one which has at least three zeros in the middle, and on both sides equal amount of non-zero numbers.


Examples:
```
amIHollow([1,1,1]) // return false
amIHollow([1,0,0,0,1]) // return true
amIHollow([7,0,0,0,-9]) // return true
amIHollow([7,0,0,0,-9,5]) // return false
amIHollow([7,0,0,-9]) // return false
amIHollow([0,0,0]) // return true
```
