# Week 36 challenge

Write a function `simplify` which takes in a fraction in the form [a, b] representing a/b. Your task is to return a simplified version, so that `[50, 70]` becomes `[5, 7]`


Examples:
```
simplify([50, 70]) // return [5,7]
simplify([150, 450]) // return [1,3]
simplify([150, 30]) // return [5,1]
```
