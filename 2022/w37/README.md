# Week 37 challenge

Write a function `ranking` which takes in an array of numbers and returns an array representing their ranks.
Ties are awarded the same rank, but the following ranks take into account how many numbers preceded them. For example
`[1, 2, 3]` results into `[3, 2, 1]`, but `[1, 2, 2, 3]` results into `[4, 2, 2, 1]`



Examples:
```
ranking([1, 2, 3]) // return [3, 2, 1]
ranking([1, 2, 2, 3]) // return [4, 2, 2, 1]
```
